## Person Tracking and Object Detection
- There are two notebooks for this:
    - TF_HUB_OD.ipynb
    - object_detection.ipynb
- In TF_HUB_OD.ipynb, the TF-Hub library is used to download the model and use it to detect objects in an image. It only works on images.
- In object_detection.ipynb, TensorFlow Object Detection API is used to detect objects in an image or video. It works on both images and videos.
- You can run the notebooks in colab
